Assalamualaikum,
I'm sharing the Git repository of my project with you. The project is structured in an organized manner, which becomes evident when you explore its folders. It extensively utilizes React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useReducer, useMemo, and useContext. Additionally, it incorporates features like pagination, reusable drawers, modals, dynamic dashboards, and sidebars. Furthermore, I've implemented advanced functionalities including forget password email verification, OTP verification, real-time user search, data fetching with SWR and Axios, authentication with NextAuth and JWT, and styling with Tailwind CSS. Additionally, I've used react-toastify for toast notifications.
Best regards,

Md Al Amin Chowdhury
